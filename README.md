# DemucsModel

**DemucsModel** is a collection of Demucs models implemented in Python for audio source separation. This repository serves as a centralized hub for various Demucs model variants, designed to separate mixed audio tracks into individual components such as **vocals**, **drums**, **bass**, and **other instruments** with high fidelity.

## Overview

**Demucs** is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for music source separation, leveraging advanced neural network architectures to isolate individual stems from mixed audio. This repository includes different versions and configurations of Demucs models, along with scripts and utilities for training, evaluation, and inference.

## Features

-   **Multiple Demucs Variants**: Includes Demucs v1, v2, v3, and hybrid models optimized for various use cases.
-   **Python Implementation**: Built with Python and compatible with **PyTorch**.
-   **Pre-trained Models**: Access to pre-trained weights for quick experimentation.
-   **Modular Design**: Easily extensible for custom model configurations or fine-tuning.
-   **Utilities**: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and audio separation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8+
-   PyTorch 1.10 or higher
-   Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/DemucsModel.git](https://github.com/yourusername/DemucsModel.git)
    cd DemucsModel
    ```
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: It's often recommended to use a virtual environment:*
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Separating Audio
To separate an audio file into its stems using a pre-trained model:

```bash
python demucs_separate.py --input /path/to/your/audio.mp3 --output /path/to/output/directory --model [model_name]
